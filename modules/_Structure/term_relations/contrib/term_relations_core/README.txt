## SUMMARY ##

Restores core support for related terms including: related terms select box on the term edit form; and the taxonomy_get_term() function.

If upgrading from 6 to 7, the existing term_relation table is renamed to taxonomy_term_relation. For fresh installs, this module will install the taxonomy_term_relation table.
